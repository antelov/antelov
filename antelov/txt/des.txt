I want to buy your premium package but I need to know if you can 
create a listing platform? Also, does this come with any backend? 
I can send you more details if you need.



Alright. Yes, I need an admin and to manage content on the website. 
Without hosting and domain is fine as I can outsource for that. 
Some description about the website, I need the listing website to 
be able for clients and companies to place request (option for bidding 
and fixed pricing). There needs to be two different profile page 
(one for clients and one for companies). Please take your time to 
look into this. I really hope you can do this website as I am also 
looking for a recurring freelancer to engage with.



Great! Thanks for getting back to me. There's a few details 
that you need to know. A brief description: the nature of the 
website is to provide a platform for homeowners to find and 
compare moving services (companies) and vice versa. We, ourselves, 
are not selling service but rather, list the request of clients. 
Hence, there are a number of items that's needed to be included. 
I've attached a list of the things that is needed, although 
I do welcome your opinion on how and what the pages should include. 
The idea of the website is still a WIP so I'll tell you more as we 
go along so I seek your understanding on this.
